### Meeting Notes from Sunday 2/2/2020
## Partners Present: Shane Canfield, Michaela Brydon, Sejin Kim (all present)

## Theme: Project Proposal, GIT assignment, and UI

# 1. Project Proposal
- A project proposal was written including organization information and an overview of the goals of our project. Descriptions of major functions and project attributes, as well as a description of the data being stored and processed was included.

# 2. GIT:
- Each member contributed to our proposal "projectproposal.md" and practiced GIT functionality doing so.

# 3. UI:
- Discussed flexibility in user input
	- User wants specific address -> Enter whole address (ex. 531 Coshocton Ave)
		- Some accounts have the same address, so there will be a long drop-down of each unique account ever associated with the address.
	- User wants everyone on a street -> Enter street name (ex. Coshocton)
    - Did you mean? "Coshocton Ave", "Coshocton St", or "Coshocton Way" user would click box indicating their correct choice.

- Marked up potential designs for the web page.
  - "Search by..." dropdown with "Address" and "Account Number" as options.
    - User would then occupy a single search bar with their desired choice.
  - Used Bootstrap Studio to create our first draft design based on a series of rough markups.

- We found color.adobe.com to find colors for our webpage
